1,Dandeniyage Somachandra De Silva,"June 11, 1942, Galle",79y 126d,Right hand bat,Legbreak googly,"One of Sri Lanka's finest legspinners, Somachandra De Silva was unfortunate that when Sri Lanka was granted full Test status he was at a stage when most players are well into retirement. He had been a fixture in the Sri Lanka team, and well respected throughout cricketing circles around the world, having played minor county cricket for Linconshire and Shropshire. With his flighted legbreaks and well disguised wrong 'uns, de Silva was a consistent wicket-taker throughout the 70s. In Sri Lanka's inaugural Test he captured 3 for 54 and 0 for 38, his first Test wicket being that of David Gower caught at the wicket by Mahes Goonatilleke. de Silva distinguished himself on the following tour to Pakistan, taking seventeen wickets in three Tests, including the first five-wicket haul by a Sri Lankan when he took 5 for 59 at Faisalabad. When Duleep Mendis was injured early on the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand, de Silva was handed the honour of leading Sri Lanka in two Tests. With the bat, he was more than useful making two half centuries, both as captain. He maintained his prominence within the game, later coaching Sri Lanka. He was later appointed cricket advisor by the Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa in December 2007 to promote the game in the country's war-hit northern areas. In 2009 De Silva was appointed chairman of a seven-member interim committee to run Sri Lanka Cricket by sports minister Gamini Lokuge."

4,Lalith Wasantha Silva Kaluperuma,"June 25, 1949, Colombo",72y 112d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Lalith Kaluperuma was an accomplished offspinner at domestic level when Sri Lanka was granted Test status. Also capable in the lower order with the bat, he failed to transfer his domestic form to the international arena. Playing in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test against England, one of three spinners, he was used sparingly as the two de Silvas, D.S. and Ajith, shared the brunt of the workload. Making the proceeding tour to Pakistan he was selected for the second Test at Faisalabad, again he was overshadowed by the de Silva's bowling only six overs in the match. He ended any chances of further representative honors choosing to join the tour of to South Africa in 1982-83. He later became a national selector and headed the selection panel in May 2005, taking over from Ashantha de Mel."
5,Louis Rohan Duleep Mendis,"August 25, 1952, Moratuwa",69y 51d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"A strong, burly, wristy batsman capable of destroying attacks at any level when the mood took him, Mendis played in key part in Sri Lanka's early days as a Test-playing country. Mendis, who had first played for Sri Lanka in 1972 while at school but was almost 30 when they played their first Test, made a shaky start, but quickly found his feet, despite having the additional burden of captaining the side from their third Test. He hit 105 in both innings against India at Madras 1982-83, and nearly repeated the feat two years later against England at Lord's, with 111 and 94. Considering the circumstances, he performed admirably leading Sri Lanka to its inaugural Test and series victory against India in 1985-86, scoring 310 runs at 62.00. Following his hundred against Pakistan the following winter he went into a steady decline, scoring only two fifties in his last 10 Tests. He was replaced as captain by Ranjan Madugalle for the tour to England in 1988, where he signed off with 56 in his final Test at Lord's. He remained in the public eye, with Sri Lanka's World Cup success coming while he was managing the side."

8,Anura Nandana Ranasinghe,"October 13, 1956, Kalutara", 42y 27d (Died) ,Right hand bat,"Left arm medium, Slow left arm orthodox","A schoolboy prodigy Anura Ranasinghe made his international debut in the 1975 World Cup against the might of the West Indies whilst still only 18 years of age. Ranasinghe played in all three matches for the Sri Lankans without producing any performance of note. His Test debut came on Sri Lanka's inaugural Test tour of Pakistan in 1981-82, but he struggled with the bat scoring 6 and 5 batting at No. 7. Despite taking the new ball he was used sparingly although he did take 1 for 23 in the first innings. His second and final Test came against India later in 1982 - he made a duck in the first innings but showed his skill in making a battling 77 second time round, a n innings which not only help Sri Lanka save the game after conceding a first-innings lead of 230, but almost allowed them to snatch a remarkable win as India closed on 135 for 7 chasing. He was expected to continue to be a key player in the fledgling Sri Lankan team but all that ended when he chose to join the infamous Sri Lankan rebel tour to South Africa in 1982-83, earning him a life ban. When that was rescinded in 1989 he resumed his club career for another couple of seasons and then moved into coaching. He died suddenly in 1998 four days before his 42nd birthday."
9,Anura Punchi Banda Tennekoon,"October 29, 1946, Anuradhapura",74y 351d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"Anura Tennekoon was a regular member of the Sri Lanka side in the years before they achieved Test status and was widely regarded as one of their great batsmen. He also captained the side. His only expose to top-flight cricket came during the 1975 and 1979 World Cups, where he acquitted himself well after a duck on his debut against West Indies. From 2000 to 2003 he was chief executive of the Sri Lankan board."
10,Michael Hugh Tissera,"March 23, 1939, Colombo",82y 206d,Right hand bat,Legbreak,"He made his two first-class centuries in unofficial Test matches for Ceylon. The first was against India in the second unofficial Test in India in 1964-65, when he made 122 in the second innings, adding 224 for the fourth wicket with Stanley Jayasinghe."
11,Bandula Warnapura,"March 01, 1953, Rambukkana",68y 228d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"Bandula Warnapura had the honour of leading Sri Lanka when they finally became a fully-fledged Test-playing country. An opening batsman with a solid technique, Warnapura was also a capable medium-pace bowler. He failed to make an impression with the bat in his four Tests, achieving his highest score of 38 in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test. His bowling was more effective in the one-day format where he had the ability to maintain a steady line and capture the occasional wicket.He had been a consistent member of early Sri Lankan teams, providing a solid presence at the top of the order. Charged with the difficult task of leading Sri Lanka in their formative years Warnapura did a commendable job. However, when he decided to tour South Africa with rebel team in 1982-83, he was handed a life ban from Sri Lankan cricket."
12,Sunil Ramsay de Silva Wettimuny,"February 02, 1949, Colombo",72y 255d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium," Sunil Wettimuny, is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played three One Day International (ODI) matches in the Cricket World Cup tournaments of 1975 and 1979 as an opening batsman."

De Silva played an important part in Sri Lanka's first ever ODI win, which was recorded over India at the 1979 Prudential World Cup match that played at Old Trafford. "
14,Roy Luke Dias,"October 18, 1952, Colombo",68y 362d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Roy Dias had an inauspicious debut for Sri Lanka at Test level, batting at No. 3; he was dismissed by Bob Willis without scoring. However, in the second innings Dias displayed his batting talents for all to see stroking an elegant 77. Dias was a joy to watch at the crease, blessed with a wonderful sense of timing, combined with a classical style. Already an experienced first-class cricketer when Sri Lanka gained Test status, Dias formed the backbone of the batting along with Duleep Mendis in the period following the Sri Lanka's inception. In the proceeding Test tour to Pakistan, Dias highlighted his class. Scoring 295 runs at 49.16, including 98 at Faisalabad and then following up with 109 at Lahore, holding firm as the top order crumbled around him in a the face of a withering barrage of pace bowling from Imran Khan. In Sri Lanka's maiden Test victory, and series victory, over India at home in 1985-86, Dias' contribution was decisive. Twin fifties in the second Test had helped set up a win, then with Sri Lanka on the brink of oblivion in the final Test, Dias rescued Sri Lanka with a superlative 106, ensuring a draw was achieved. Following retirement, Dias maintained his profile in the game coaching Sri Lanka for a period."
15,Sunil Asoka Jayasinghe,"July 15, 1955, Matugama",39y 279d (Died) ,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,He  was a former Sri Lankan ODI cricketer who played two ODIs in the 1979 World Cup competition.

18,Ranjan Senerath Madugalle,"April 22, 1959, Kandy",62y 176d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,He became an ICC match referee in 1993 and in 2001 he was appointed as the first chief referee. His easy-going exterior and charming personality are a mask for someone who has a reputation as a strict disciplinarian.
19,Ashantha Lakdasa Francis de Mel,"May 09, 1959, Colombo",62y 159d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"He was a brisk right-arm bowler with the ability to gain genuine outswing, Ashantha de Mel was Sri Lanka's leading pace bowler following their elevation to full Test status. In Sri Lanka's inaugural test against England in 1981-82, de Mel took a highly creditable 4 for 70 and 1 for 33. In the following tour of Pakistan, he toiled willingly, taking 11 wickets. In the one-off Test against India in 1982-83, he became the first Sri Lankan fast bowler to take a five-wicket haul, grabbing 5 for 68 in the second innings. With the bat, de Mel was a handy performer, capable of valuable contributions in the lower order with his aggressive style. A serious knee injury brought his career to a premature end after the 1987 World Cup, but he went on to represent Sri Lanka at bridge, including an appearance at the Commonwealth Games. He also served on the interim committee of the Sri Lanka cricket board, and was a national selector and manager of the under-19 side"
20,Rohan Stanley Amarasiriwardene Jayasekera,"December 07, 1957, Colombo",63y 312d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"Rohan Jayasekera toured England in 1979 with the Sri Lankan team performing the dual role as a forceful batsman and reserve wicketkeeper to Stanley Jayasinghe. However, he did not play in the World Cup as Jayasinghe was preferred. Making his debut in Sri Lanka's inaugural one-day international on home soil against England, he kept wicket and scored 17 as Sri Lanka were defeated by six runs in a thrilling encounter. His sole Test came on the tour of Pakistan when he played as a specialist batsman at Lahore. Imran Khan routed Sri Lanka, taking 14 wickets, Jayasekera constituted two of those, bowled for 0 and 2. Not selected again, Jayasekera became another member of the exclusive one-Test club."
21,Sidath Wettimuny,"August 12, 1956, Colombo",65y 64d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"Sidath Wettimuny was a fixture at the top of the order following Sri Lanka's inauguration into the Test arena. Wettimuny was a solid right-hand batsman with a compact technique. Wettimuny was the younger of two brothers to play for Sri Lanka; in fact in a rare instance he opened the batting with his brother, Mithra, in two Test matches. Wettimuny made two centuries at test level both of them having historical significance. At Faisalabad, on Sri Lanka's initial overseas tour, Wettimuny stroked a 157, sharing a partnership of 217 with Roy Dias for the second wicket. It was the maiden century at Test level by a Sri Lankan player. At Lord's in 1984, Wettimuny eclipsed his previous effort scoring a superlative 190 in 642 minutes facing 471 balls. Marvellous strokeplay and a steely determination to succeed punctuated the innings. Wettimuny also became the first Sri Lankan to carry his bat through an innings when he completed the feat against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1982-83 - he scored an unbeaten 63 out of a meager total of 144."
22,Hettiarachige Mahes Goonatilleke,"August 16, 1952, Kegalle",69y 60d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"An efficient gloveman and proficient batsman in the lower order, Goonatilleke was Sri Lanka's wicketkeeper during their initial foray into the Test arena. An accomplished player, Goonatilleke established his position in the side leading up to the Sri Lanka's Test debut. His performances in Tests were promising, as he was a capable performer behind the wickets comfortable against pace or spin. With the bat he provided great resistance producing some handy performances. Such was his ability he was asked to open the batting in the second Test at Faisalabad. He performed admirably scoring 27 in the first innings and then top-scoring with 57 in the second innings, providing stoic resistance as the batting capitulated around him. Sri Lanka were robbed of a quality player when he disappointingly opted to tour South Africa in 1982-83, ending his Test career overnight."
23,Arjuna Ranatunga,"December 01, 1963, Colombo",57y 318d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium,"Arjuna Ranatunga is a stockily-built left-handed batsman who led Sri Lanka to their greatest cricketing triumph, the 1996 World Cup. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team given little chance prior to the competition for cricket's greatest prize. He made his debut in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test at the age of 18, and made his country's first Test half-century. A dominant figure on cricket fields all over the world for nearly 20 years, he never shied from confrontation, defending his players and rights to the hilt."
24,Joseph Ravindran Ratnayeke,"May 02, 1960, Colombo",61y 166d,Left hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Ravi Ratnayeke was a player capable of genuine allround performances with both bat and ball in hand. A right-arm medium-pace bowler with the ability to bowl at a lively pace and move the ball in favorable conditions. To compliment his ability with the ball he was also a competent left-hand batsman in the lower order. As his career developed so did his batting, such was his ability he was asked to open the batting at test level and did so with success. Perhaps his greatest attribute was his tenacity and resolve, always willing to compete in a side that was usually less than competitive. Scripted into the side as a 21 year old, Ratnayeke was originally selected as a specialist bowler. On the unresponsive wickets in Pakistan he toiled in relative obscurity earning four expensive wickets and batting as low as No. 10. Wickets and runs were difficult to come by at first, but the selectors persevered and against New Zealand at the SSC he had a breakthrough when he took 5 for 42. The back-to-back series against Pakistan enabled Ratnayeke cement his position in the side with impressive displays with the ball and his ever improving batting provided valuable runs in the lower order. At Sialkot he produced a devastating display wrecking the Pakistan innings with figures of 8 for 83, the figures remaining the benchmark for all Sri Lankan bowlers until recent times. Pushed into the opening position on the tour of India in 1985-86, Ratnayeke responded to the added responsibility. In his debut innings combating the new ball he scored a remarkable 93 adding 159 with Siddath Wettimuny, later capturing 4 wickets in a superb allround display. In the second Test, as Sri Lanka capitulated he held firm top scoring with 54, upstaging his more distinguished colleagues. He completed an outstanding series capturing 5 for 85 in the final test at Cuttack. This determination and competitive nature was highlighted in his series against Australia. In 1988 he toiled manfully as Australia crushed the Sri Lankans, capturing 4 for 98 in 40 tidy overs. With the bat he scored 28 and 34 as the rest of the batting yielded. In the next series in Australia, the penultimate in his career, he batted with purpose and resolve scoring two fifties both when Sri Lanka were at their greatest need."
25,Roger Gerard Christopher Ediriweera Wijesuriya,"February 18, 1960, Moratuwa",61y 240d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"Sri Lankan left-arm spinner Roger Wijesuriya has a claim to being the most toothless bowler in Test history. He played four Tests between 1982 and 1986, and had a strike rate of a wicket every 586 balls. On average it took Wijesuriya 97 overs to take a wicket. In other words, if he bowled at both ends throughout a five-day Test, the opposition would be only four down at the end of the match ... and they would have scored 1355 runs. He made more impression earlier in his career when he took 25 wickets in an U19 series against Pakistan."
26,Vinothen Bede John ( Vinothen John Bede Jeyarajasingham),"May 27, 1960, Colombo",61y 141d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"Vinod John had a brief but successful international career. A robust medium-pace bowler, John made his debut against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1982-83. The second Test highlighted his ability as he made inroads into the middle lower-order taking 5 for 60. In the return series in 1983-84, John consistently troubled the New Zealand batsman to capture 16 wickets in the three Tests. In the Lord's Test against England, his final Test match, he put in a wholehearted performance bowling 39.1 overs conceding a mere 98 runs, taking four wickets in the process. In the one-day format he had less success though he maintained a reasonable economy rate."
27,Rumesh Joseph Ratnayake,"January 02, 1964, Colombo",57y 286d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"The wiry Ratnayake made his debut as teenager and displayed the ability to generate pace and bounce with his whippy action. Ratnayake was a consistent performer during the late eighties and early nineties troubling batsman with his ability to swing the new ball at a lively pace. However, due to injury he was never able to really fulfill his potential, though he showed determination to return to test cricket he was never quite the same bowler as in his younger days. Nevertheless he was a fine test bowler and one of the better pace bowlers produced by the island nation. A capable hitter in the lower order Ratnayake played some handy innings with the bat."
28,Ronald Guy De Alwis,"February 15, 1960, Colombo",52y 332d (Died),Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"De Alwis had a constant tussle with Amal Silva to maintain the No.1 wicketkeeping berth. Quite tall, De Alwis was considered the superior keeper, though Silva held the upper hand in the batting stakes by quite a stretch. Mahes Goonatilleke's defection allowed de Alwis to make his debut on the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand. One of seven debutants in the first Test at Christchurch, de Alwis scored 0 and 3 and took one catch. Amal Silva was preferred in the next match, though De Alwis kept in all three Tests when New Zealand toured Sri Lanka. De Alwis's keeping was exemplary and while he made some handy scores in the lower order he could not convert them. Injury on the 1984 tour of England cost him his place, and Silva had a tremendous Test at Lords and kept his place with some solid knocks thereafter. In his further Tests - when Silva was injured or unwell - de Alwis kept tidily but his batting was below standard. Conversely in the one-day game de Alwis was quite a useful lower-order batsman."
29,Ellekutige Rufus Nemesion Susil Fernando,"December 19, 1955, Colombo",65y 300d,Right hand bat,Not Bowled,who played in 5 Tests and 7 ODIs from 1983 to 1984.
30,Yohan Goonasekera,"November 08, 1957, Colombo",63y 341d,Left hand bat,"Left arm medium, Slow left arm orthodox","One of many players given an opportunity on the 1982/83 series of New Zealand it proved to be Goonasekera's only international series. Against a high class New Zealand pace attack featuring Sir Richard Hadlee, Cairns, Chatfield and Snedden he had a torrid time although his scores did improve each innings. Goonasekera's notable achievement was snaring four catches in the first innings of the second Test at Wellington, a record effort by a Sri Lankan equaled by Hashan Tillekeratne a decade later. The left handed batsman had an improved series in the one day encounters though it was not enough to convince the selectors to persevere with him."
31,Mithra de Silva Wettimuny,"June 11, 1951, Colombo",67y 223d (Died) ,Right hand bat,Not Bowled,"Mithra Wettimuny's cricket career was brief - of his nine first-class appearances, two were Tests, only one was in Sri Lanka, and they spanned a little over four months in 1982-83. A diminutive top-order right-hand batsman, he scored fifty on his first-class debut in Zimbabwe, but failed to do so in any of his remaining outings. Despite this, he was selected to tour New Zealand, making his two Test appearances on that tour where he managed 28 runs in four innings. They were his last first-class matches. In the first of these games he opened the innings with his younger brother, Sidath - only the third instance of brothers opening together. Their older brother, Sunil, also played for Sri Lanka before they gained Test status"
32,Sridharan Jeganathan,"July 11, 1951, Colombo",44y 308d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"The first Sri Lankan Test player to die, allrounder Srid�haran Jeganathan passed away on May 14, aged 44. A left-arm spinner and lower-order right-hand batsman, Jeganathan played in both Tests of the injury-hit tour of New Zealand in 1982-83. His disappointing return of 19 runs (4.75) included four single-figure scores, and he failed to take a wicket. Ignored for a while, he was recalled for the 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan, dismissing Richie Richardson of West Indies and taking both wickets (Gooch and Robinson) in the eight�wicket defeat by England at Pune. His 2 for 45 there remained his best bowling in five one-day internationals, in which he took five wickets (41.60) and scored 25 runs (8.33). Jeganathan had toured Eng�land with the team which won the inaugural ICC Trophy in 1979, and took 4 for 92 against Nottinghamshire. In all first�class cricket he took 49 wickets (31.61), and scored 437 runs at 13.66. His highest score, of 74, was made against Tasmania at Devonport on that 1982-83 tour: coming in at 89 for 7, he put on 140 for the eight wicket with Ravi Ratnayeke (64 not out). He later became Malaysia's national coach."
33,Granville Nissanka de Silva,"March 12, 1955, Colombo",66y 217d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,He is a Sri Lankan former cricketer who played four ODI matches between 1983 and 1985.
34,Don Sardha Brendon Priyantha Kuruppu,"January 05, 1962, Colombo",59y 283d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"Greatness was firmly thrust upon Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-opener Brendon Kuruppu, but only for a day or two, as he became only the third person to score a double-century on his Test debut, against New Zealand - Richard Hadlee and all - in Colombo. Kuruppu did it the hard way too: his 777-minute innings is the slowest double-hundred in first-class history, all very out of character for a man who later made his reputation as a one-day slogger. It was his first first-class century, and his last Test century: Kuruppu only played four Tests, two of them in England, in 1988 and 1991."
35,Maitipage Athula Rohitha Samarasekera,"August 05, 1961, Colombo",60y 71d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"Athula Samarasekera was an imposing figure; a strapping physique leant him the ability to play some commanding innings. With the bat in hand he was capable of powerful strikes and was a more than handy medium-pace bowler. Samarasekera made an inauspicious start to his career, scoring a duck on his one-day international debut. On his Test debut he matched the performance, being dismissed in the first innings for a duck. In the second innings he played a characteristically breezy innings making 57, punctuated by a number of boundaries. He completed a promising allround match capturing two wickets and taking two catches. Too often though Samarasekera was dismissed when he seemed set to dominate the bowling, a substantial score beckoning. When he did score it was well worth watching as he provided maximum entertainment with his aggressive style. Never able to fully establish a permanent position in the team, Samarasekera chose to end his international career by deciding to take up professional cricket in Bangladesh."
36,Pinnaduwage Aravinda de Silva,"October 17, 1965, Colombo",55y 363d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"One of the game's best entertainers, de Silva possessed the strengths of many of the tallest short run-scorers: unruffable technique, strong at cutting and hooking, an unrepentant attacker. His record is unrivalled among countrymen, his place in history secure after a match-winning century in a World Cup final. He stands 5ft 3 1/2in and arguably there has not been a better smaller player. His enthusiasm was amazing: he was a virtual ever-present in the Sri Lanka side and also played first-class and club cricket in England, South Africa and Australia. His international career ended with the 2003 World Cup, where he batted with all the verve and panache of old, and bowled his offspinners cannily. Sri Lanka's cricket authorities ensured that his wealth of cricketing experience would not go waste, appointing him a national selector. His other main interests are cakes and cars (usually fast ones)."
37,Shaul Hameed Uvais Karnain,"August 11, 1962, Colombo",59y 65d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"A right-arm medium-pace bowler and proficient batsman in the lower order Karnain showed signs of developing into a handy allrounder at one-day level. Karnain made a stunning debut against New Zealand on a dicey wicket at Moratuwa. With the bat he helped Arjuna Ranatunga rescue Sri Lanka from 69 for 5 scoring 28 valuable runs. Then with the ball he sliced through the Kiwi top order capturing 5 for 26, in the process guiding Sri Lanka to victory and earning himself the Man of the Match award. On the 1984-85 World Series tour of Australia followed by the World Championship of Cricket he continued to show promise playing some handy knocks and providing a useful option with his medium pace though he was rather expensive on the pacy wickets of Australia. Though never quite able to live up to those heady heights of his debut match he performed admirably with the ball and bat during his limited-overs career."
38,Sampathwaduge Amal Rohitha Silva,"December 12, 1960, Moratuwa",60y 307d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak Wicketkeeper,"Amal Silva filled two vital roles in his time with the Sri Lankan team and he did both with style, though eventually the burden was too much for one player to deal with. Silva, a capable left hand batsman and competent wicketkeeper, was asked to fill the opening position combined with his role as wicketkeeper."
39,Dudley Marlon Vonhagt,"March 31, 1965, Kalutara",56y 198d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"An opening batsman, Marlon Vonhagt made his debut in Sri Lanka's one-day side in Australia when aged 19 in 1984-85, picked for the side on the strength of a good tour of England in 1984. But appearances thereafter were limited - he all but stopped playing after 1986, returning for three matches for Moors Sports Club in 1988-89 with some success."
40,Franklyn Saliya Ahangama,"September 14, 1959, Colombo",62y 31d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium,"Franklyn Saliya Ahangama had a meteoric rise to the Sri Lankan Test side. After making his first-class debut for the Sri Lankan Colts in 1985-86, he found himself thrust into the Test side to play India a mere two weeks later. He had a triumphant entry into Test cricket capturing the wicket of Mohammad Azharuddin with only his fourth ball finishing with a match analysis of 5 for 109. In the third Test at Kandy he returned a career-best 5 for 52, ending the three-Test series with 18 wickets at 19.33. Sri Lanka's lack of Test cricket and injuries prevented him from appearing in more, and despite touring England in 1988 and 1991 he never played another Test. He subsequently moved into broadcasting as a television commentator."
41,Asanka Pradeep Gurusinha,"September 16, 1966, Colombo",55y 29d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium Wicketkeeper,"A technically accomplished No. 3, Asanka Gurusinha was the rock on which the Sri Lankan batting was founded for 11 years. His gutsy lone battles earned the respect of opponents around the world: a Sri Lankan total of 82 in Chandigarh in 1990-91 contained an unbeaten Gurusinha half-century; at Melbourne in 1995-96, he scored 143 to his team-mates' 144; and with Aravinda de Silva's help, he turned the tables on Australia in the 1996 World Cup final with another half-century. He started Test cricket as a teenager as a wicketkeeper-batsman, but retired prematurely a year after the World Cup triumph after refusing to return home for training from a season of club cricket in Melbourne, where he now lives. He was badly missed"
42,Sangarange Don Anurasiri,"February 25, 1966, Panadura",55y 232d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"A steady left-arm orthodox spinner, Don Anurasiri had a static international career. After making his international debut at the age of 20, he remained around the fringes of the team for a number of seasons without ever cementing a permanent position. Whenever called upon he was a wholehearted performer, though at Test level his bowling lacked penetration, highlighted by the fact he never took a five wicket haul in 18 Tests. Capable of extended spells of sustained accurate bowling, willing to flight and turn the ball, Anurasiri was often used to contain the batsman on unresponsive wickets. He enjoyed his most successful series against the touring Australians in 1992-93, taking 10 wickets. Anurasiri's career at the international level appeared over when he fell out with the SL board in 1994. However, four years later he made a surprise comeback against Zimbabwe in the final Test in 1997-98. Spinning the ball away from the bat he provided a solid foil for Muttiah Muralitharan, capturing 3 for 65 and 1 for 41, and in the process helped Sri Lanka to victory. But he played only three more first-class games, and within six weeks of his final Test appearance his career was over."
43,Ashley Matthew de Silva,"December 03, 1963, Colombo",57y 316d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"An experienced domestic player when selected to play for Sri Lanka, de Silva's sojourn at international level was a brief one. Making his first class debut in 1984 de Silva had been a steady performer for the Colombo Cricket Club throughout the 80's and early 90's. Sri Lanka's failure to develop a quality test wicketkeeper saw de Silva receive an call up for the one off test against England. Sri Lanka achieved their first test victory over the English, de Silva contributing 9 runs, a catch and one stumping. De Silva's batting failed to impress at international level in his few outings, failing to reach double figures in any innings, and was omitted from the side. His name added to the ever expanding list of former Sri Lankan test wicketkeepers."
44,Roshan Siriwardene Mahanama,"May 31, 1966, Colombo",55y 137d,Right hand bat,Not Bowled,"A dashing right-hand batsman and brilliant fielder Roshan Mahanama's is best remembered as a cricketer for his world record second wicket partnership of 576 with Sanath Jayasuriya in a Test match against India at the R Premadasa Stadium in 1997, since surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene in 2006. Mahanama's contribution to that partnership was 225, the highest score of his career. He was a key member of Sri Lanka's World Cup winning side of 1996. Following his team's disastrous showing in the 1999 World Cup, Mahanama was dropped from the side to groom young talent. But when players older than him still found a place it hurt Mahanama and as a matter of principle and self-respect he decided to retire. Soon after Mahanama put out his biography 'Retired Hurt' which delves deeply into the ups and downs of his career. His affable character and good breeding saw him follow Ranjan Madugalle as an ICC match referee in May 2004, a role he has fulfilled quite competently."
45,Kahawalage Gamini Perera,"May 22, 1964, Colombo",57y 146d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,He is a Sri Lankan cricketer who played four ODIs in 1986.

47,Kaushik Naginda Amalean,"April 07, 1965, Colombo",56y 191d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Kaushik Amalean was selected to play for Sri Lanka as a twenty year old in the final Test of the 1985-86 home series against Pakistan. An impressive display against an England B team had brought his name to the selectors attention. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, he was capable of bowling at a sharp pace gaining inswing with his action. Given the new ball he responded by taking 3 for 59, including the wickets of Moshin Khan and Javed Miandad. Amalean's only other Test match was played on the 1987-88 tour to Australia, when Sri Lanka were crushed at Perth in the one-off Test, though Amalean took a respectable 4 for 97 in Australia's only innings."
48,Champaka Priyadarshana Hewage Ramanayake,"January 08, 1965, Colombo",56y 280d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Ramanayake was a wholehearted performer, a willing worker with a steely determination - he never shirked the issue. During a period when Sri Lanka lacked a true pace bowling threat Ramanayake, a genuine medium pacer, bore the brunt of the work-load. Ramanayake lacked the raw pace to be a genuine wicket-taking threat at Test level. An honest toiler he usually managed to check the batsman without dismissing them."
49,Graeme Fredrick Labrooy,"June 07, 1964, Colombo",57y 130d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"A medium-fast bowler capable of producing displays of quality swing bowling, Graeme Labrooy modeled his text book action on Richard Hadlee. Labrooy formed what seemed to be a promising new ball partnership with Rumesh Ratnayake but for a variety of reasons his Test career was brief. Capable with the bat, on his day he could produce an attacking array of strokes that often set the opposition team aback with its ferocity. Labrooy made an inauspicious debut against India, batting at No. 11 and taking one expensive wicket as batsmen dominated the Test. At Lord's against England he added 64 for the last wicket with Ravi Ratnayeke, scoring 42 stylish runs while claiming 4 wickets with the ball. His development was held back by Sri Lanka's sporadic Test schedule. Due to the political tension in his homeland all of his nine Tests spread over a lengthy period, were played overseas. On the Australian tour he captured his first five wicket haul taking 5 for 133 at the Gabba. On the tour of New Zealand he just seemed to finding his feet at international level taking the new ball with Rumesh Ratnayake. With the ball he captured 13 wickets. In the third Test at Auckland, unfortunately his final Test, he had a superb allround match. With the ball he captured 3 for 48 and 4 for 42 and with the bat he launched an astonishing display battering the Kiwi attack, scoring an unbeaten 70 in 80 balls with 14 boundaries."
50,Hashan Prasantha Tillakaratne,"July 14, 1967, Colombo",54y 93d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak Wicketkeeper,"A tough competitor and adhesive crease-occupier, Hashan Tillakaratne was an important figure in Sri Lanka's emergence as an international force. As a schoolboy he excelled at cricket, first at Isipathana College Colombo and then subsequently at DS Senanayake College. He first came to prominence with a match-saving century against England B at Galle in 1986 while still at school, and went on to make his one-day international debut against India in November of that year. A Test debut followed against Australia three years later and early on in his Test career Tillakaratne often played as batsman-wicketkeeper."
51,Ellawalakankanamge Asoka Ranjit de Silva,"March 28, 1956, Kalutara",65y 211d,Left hand bat,Legbreak googly,"Following an international cricket career from 1985-1992 where he represented his country in 10 Tests and 28 ODIs as a right-arm leg-spinner, Asoka de Silva quickly emerged as Sri Lanka's best-regarded cricket umpire. After he retired from first-class cricket in 1996/97 De Silva became a fully qualified coach before turning his attention to umpiring. He made his international debut at Galle against Pakistan in 1999/00 and was on the ICC's Elite Umpires Panel for a brief period of time before being relegated in early 2004. He however remains a member of the ICC International Umpires Panel and is often appointed to matches to support the Elite panel during busy periods in the international cricket season. Has umpired in two Cricket World Cups in 2003 and 2007."
52,Sanath Mohan Silva Kaluperuma,"October 22, 1961, Colombo",60y 3d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A right hand top-order batsman and handy off-spin bowler Kaluperuma struggled to adjust in his brief opportunity at international level. Blooded during a period in which Sri Lanka was searching for players with the ability and determination to succeed at the highest level, Kaluperuma's form for the under 23 side brought him to the attention of the selectors. Making his debut against New Zealand batting at number three he failed to make an impression with the bat although he did capture 2/17 with his off-spinners. Playing all three Tests in the series, he failed to pass 30 in his six innings and he was dropped. Earning a recall nearly four years after his previous opportunity for the one off Test against Australia at Perth, Kaluperuma suffered a torrid time and it proved to be his final Test."
53,Madurasinghe Arachchige Wijayasiri Ranjith Madurasinghe,"January 30, 1961, Kurunegala",60y 268d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Highly rated in domestic circles, Madurusinghe failed to make an impact at international level in his limited opportunities. With his tall build, Madurusinghe could gain bounce when delivering his well-flighted offspin. He went wicketless in his debut against England at Lord's in 1988, but had greater success in his second Test. Against a highly rated Indian batting line-up at Chandigarh, he took 3 for 60, including the wickets of Mohammad Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkar. Surprisingly he was not chosen again until the 1992-93 series against Australia, where playing in the opening Test at the SSC - he was used sparingly and again was wicketless. It proved to be his final international match, the emergence of Muttiah Muralitharan putting paid to any further opportunities. He remained a fine bowler at domestic level and a more than capable lower-order batsman."
54,Kapila Indaka Weerakkody Wijegunawardene,"November 23, 1964, Colombo",56y 336d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Kapila Wijegunawardene was a steady medium pace bowler who served Sri Lanka well when chosen. At international level he lacked a yard in pace to be a genuine threat but with an accurate line and the ability to move the ball he could cause batsman trouble if they underestimated his ability. The selectors clearly had Wijegunawardene pegged as strictly a one day bowler and it was in this form of the game that he made his international debut. Taking 2/29 from 8 tidy overs he helped Sri Lanka to a win over Pakistan in his initial match. His Test debut came on the tour of England in 1991 in the one off Test, where he was used sparingly and went wicketless. In his second and final Test against Pakistan at Faisalabad he had a prosperous time having the match analysis of 7/98, and in the second innings his 4/51 nearly bowled Sri Lanka to a memorable victory."

56,Thewarathantrige Lalithamana Fernando,"1962, December 27",58y 302d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,He has played only one match Australia vs Sri Lanka at Margo in 1989.
57,Sanath Teran Jayasuriya,"June 30, 1969, Matara",52y 117d,Left hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"It's hard to imagine that for the first half-decade of his career, Sanath Jayasuriya was considered a bowler who could bat a bit. Think of him now and you think of forearms straight out of a smithy, shots hammered through point and cover and scythes over the leg side. You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did."
58,Marvan Samson Atapattu,"November 22, 1970, Kalutara",50y 337d,Right hand bat,Legbreak,"A vulnerable starter, Atapattu showed immense strength of character once he got his eye in. On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. All his big Test innings - he scored six double-hundreds in his career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond and Brian Lara (seven each) - were been slow affairs but the most tortuous episode of his international career was its start: it took him nearly seven years to get established. However, since the 1990s his average climbed upwards. An elegant player to watch, Atapattu's signature shot was his high-elbow cover-drive."
59,Dammika Ranatunga,"October 12, 1962, Colombo",59y 13d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"The eldest of three brothers to represent Sri Lanka at Test level Dhammika Ranatunga had a brief sojourn in the international arena. A stoic opening batsman unsurprisingly blessed with an unflappable temperament Ranatunga opened the batting for Sri Lanka on the tour of Australia in 1990-91. Though it proved to be his only Test series he performed admirably batting with patience and resoluteness making 40 in his debut innings, and following up with 45 at Hobart. His introverted style seemed suited to the longer format of the game and in his limited chances at one-day level he struggled. He subsequently became an influential administrator in the Sri Lankan cricket hierarchy, and was chief executive of the Cricket Board."
60,Romesh Shantha Kaluwitharana,"November 24, 1969, Colombo",51y 335d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"The diminutive ""Kalu"" burst onto the international scene with an unbeaten 132 on debut against Australia in 1992-93. However, after such a wonderful start, he failed to secure his place in the senior side because of occasional lapses behind the stumps. He was recalled for the crucial 1995-96 tour of Australia, the turning point of his career as he combined with Sanath Jayasuriya to form a devastating pinch-hitting opening partnership. The pair's scoring rate revolutionalised one-day batting, and he was an integral figure in Sri Lanka's astonishing World Cup victory that winter. From then on, his batting style tempered somewhat and he set himself to play longer innings. The emergence of Kumar Sangakkara led to his marginalisation after 2000, although he made sporadic returns for both the one-day and Test team"
61,Kahakatchchi Patabandige Jayananda Warnaweera,"November 23, 1960, Matara",60y 336d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium,"Warnaweera was an effective bowler in his limited Test career. An offspinner, Warnaweera bowled the ball at a quick pace but questions over the legality of his action eventually saw him sanctioned from the international arena."
62,Charith Panduka Senanayake,"December 19, 1962, Colombo",58y 310d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium,"Charith Senanayake was given an opportunity to establish his position as an opener on the 1990-91 tour of New Zealand. A left-hand batsman, he was a capable strokeplayer but was probably better suited down the order on the New Zealand wickets where his defence was questionable against the new ball. In the second Test at Hamilton he made his highest test score of 64, adding 95 for the first wicket with Chandika Hathurusinghe. With Roshan Mahanama and Hathurusinghe forming a solid opening pair Senanayake was not given another opportunity following the tour. In seven one-day internationals he failed to impress somewhat surprisingly, as the free scoring nature of the game seemed to suit his mentality."
63,Gallage Pramodya Wickramasinghe,"August 14, 1971, Matara",50y 72d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Pramodya Wickramasinghe, or 'Wicky' as he was known, was a reliable medium-fast bowler, who lent valuable experience and control to the attack. Relatively gentle in pace, he relied on accuracy and movement in the air. He was educated at Rahula College in Matara and played his club cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club. He was introduced into the national pool after the Youth Asia Cup Championships in Bangladesh in 1989 and toured England with the Sri Lankan 'B' team in 1991. In 1992 he recorded the historic feat of capturing all ten wickets in an innings when he finished with 10 for 41 against Kalutura YCC. In 2000 he was forced to undergo surgery on his shoulder in Australia and found it difficult to cement his place in the side upon his return"
64,Upul Chandika Hathurusingha,"September 13, 1968, Colombo",53y 42d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"An opening batsman with a compact style and steadfast nature, Hathurusingha forged a steady opening partnership with Roshan Mahanama. Capable of playing lengthy innings when the situation warranted ,Hathurusingha possessed a variety of strokes. A handy medium-pace bowler, capable of genuine movement through the air. Called into the side against New Zealand at Hamilton as a replacement for the injured Mahanama, he responded by making three half-centuries in his first three Tests. Despite some handy contributions in following series, after an arduous time against the pace of South Africans he found himself left out. After a period on the sidelines, during which no other opener could establish a permanent position, he was selected to tour Pakistan and responded with an excellent series. After the emergence of Sanath Jayasuriya on the proceeding tour of Australia, Hathurusingha was again left out. Sri Lanka's failure to develop a competent allrounder saw Hathrurusingha reincarnated as a middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler during the tour of England and The Asian Test Championship, though this experiment was shortlived. Chosen for the 1999 World Cup, Hathurusinghe was not called upon to play a single match, and the selectors' policy of picking younger players singled the end to his international career. He quit first-class cricket in 2005 to focus on coaching and has since coached UAE and Sri Lanka A."
65,Ruwan Senani Kalpage,"February 19, 1970, Kandy",51y 248d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A combative allround cricketer Kalpage has been a handy performer in the shorter format of the game where his allround skill makes him a valuable utility player. In the Test arena his appearances have been far more infrequent as he has struggled to find a defining role in the team, not being strong enough to warrant a position as either a batsman or bowler."
66,Dulip Kapila Liyanage,"June 06, 1972, Kalutara",49y 141d,Left hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Dulip Liyanage, a fast-medium bowler, was a hard-working pace bowler who made his Test debut alongside Muttiah Muralitharan in Colombo in 1992-93. He had an impressive debut, taking the wicket of Tom Moody with his third ball and going onto claim the wickets of Alan Border and David Boon. In the two Tests whcih followed against New Zealand he continued his promising form taking seven wickets in a series generally dominated by Sri Lanka's spinners. On the unresponsive pitches. Injury limited his future opportunities and he drifted into obscurity before making a surprise, albeit short-lived, return to the international arena at one day level in 1997. He represented Sri Lanka in seven ODIs after his return, but after the Wills Quadrangular tournament in Pakistan he was injured again. After an impressive season with Colts CC he was given another chance and recalled to the squad for India's tour of Sri Lanka in August 2001. He played in the final Colombo Test."
67,Anguppulige Gamini Dayantha Wickremasinghe,"December 27, 1965, Colombo",55y 302d,Right hand bat,rigth arm offbreak,"Gamini Wickremasinghe was a victim of the selectors whims. A solid performer behind the wickets and a determined lower-order batsman, he was never given a chance to establish a permanent position within the national team. Ironically the selectors preferred his Nondescripts team-mate Hashan Tillekeratne as the Sri Lankan wicketkeeper despite the fact that at club level Wickremasinghe held the position while Tillekeratne played as a specialist batsman. Wickremasinghe made his Test debut against Australia at the Gabba on the 1989-90 tour taking three catches behind the wicket and scoring two runs. Injury forced him to miss the second test at Hobart and Tillekeratne took over the position giving an impressive display. From that point on Wickremasinghe was cast into the background as the selectors preferred Tillekeratne due to his pedigree as a batsman at domestic level. Wickremasinghe continued to be a steady, capable performer at domestic level and earned a recall against New Zealand in 1992-93. Sri Lanka won the series and Wickremasinghe gave an assured display behind the wickets dealing with the spin of Muralitharan, Warnaweera and Anurasiri with style. However, the selectors in their wisdom not for the first time chose to plump for the player with superior batting skills. For the next few years a number of candidates were tried without much success while Wickremasinghe continued to perform reliably at domestic level. Given the chance he could have made the position his own."
68,Nishantha Ranatunga,"January 22, 1966, Gampaha",55y 276d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"His Odi debut Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe at Sharjah - February 03,19993 and Last odi Sri Lanka vs Pakistan at sharjah -February 04,1993"
69,Muthiah Muralidaran,"April 17, 1972, Kandy",49y 191d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Perhaps no cricketer since Douglas Jardine has polarised opinion quite like Muthiah Muralidaran. For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed.Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa."
70,Pubudu Bathiya Dassanayake,"July 11, 1970, Kandy",51y 106d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"After a brief period as the first choice keeper, Dassanayake joined the ever increasing list of players to have held the position. His batting fell below that of international standards and that led to him being replaced. Despite this when asked to bat at first drop to counter the threat of the South African pace attack, which had been demolishing the top order, he did so with courage. After Chamara Dunusinghe was preferred for the tour to New Zealand in 1994/95, Dassanayake made a return to the international scene, representing Sri Lanka 'A' against England A in 1998"

72,Dulip Prasanna Samaraweera,"February 12, 1972, Colombo",49y 256d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Dulip Samaraweera was a determined stoic opening batsman. Chosen as a replacement for Chandika Hathrurusinghe, Samaraweera did not do enough in his limited opportunities to warrant further selection. Making his debut against the West Indies in the inaugural Test between the two nations, he scored 16 and 5. In the following three-Test series against India he failed to pass 50 in any of his six innings. A solid batsman at domestic level, for Sri Lanka he fell below the required standard. When he did see off the opening bowlers he failed to display the required strokeplay to take full advantage, failing to pass 50 in 14 Test innings. He was a handy offspiner."
73,Angelo Davis Mathews,"June 02, 1987, Colombo",34y 145d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"A robust batting technique, nagging consistency with the ball, and athleticism in the field, all set off by an imperturbable temperament, have made Angelo Mathews one of Sri Lanka's most prized assets and a figure on which the team hangs many hopes. He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years."
74,Hewa Kaluhalamullage Suraj Randiv Kaluhalamulla,"January 30, 1985, Matara",36y 268d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A tall offspinner with gentle action, Suraj Randiv has eschewed the mystery balls many of his colleagues deal in and has instead forged a career reliant on flight, dip and, importantly, bounce. The topspinner and the arm ball are his only variations, and even his offbreak is not given to excessive turn."
75,Ranasinghe Arachchige Suranga Lakmal,"March 10, 1987, Matara",34y 229d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"A right-arm fast bowler, Suranga Lakmal was first spotted by Sri Lanka Cricket's fast bowling coaches while still a student at Debarawewa Central. They closely monitored his progress to Richmond College and then to the Tamil Union team whom he represents in domestic cricket. What impressed the coaches about Lakmal was his height and ability to get bounce and swing at a tender age. Despite his natural ability, Lakmal had one big deficiency in that he lacked the stamina to bowl long spells and on occasions he did, he regularly fell ill. The lack of nutrition was quite common with fast bowlers coming from outside Colombo and soon after Lakmal was inducted into the academy, the coaches worked on developing his stamina. Good performances with Sri Lanka A saw him break into the national ODI side. He was one of three players marked for the future by Chandika Hathurusingha in 2008 when he coached the A side."
76,Narangoda Liyanaarachchilage Thisara Chirantha Perera,"April 03, 1989, Colombo",32y 205d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"A bustling right-arm seamer and sporadically effective left-handed hitter, Thisara Perera has been been in Sri Lanka's short-format sides since 2010. Bowling is ostensibly Perera's major skill but, often deployed in the lower-middle order, he is also capable of delivering furious finishes to an innings. Perera is particularly severe on spin, which has led to his being used as a pinch-hitter through the middle overs, but he has at times also been weak to quality pace bowling."
77,Hettige Don Rumesh Lahiru Thirimanne,"August 09, 1989, Moratuwa",32y 77d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"An unflappable young talent with a killer cover drive, Lahiru Thirimanne came to the international landscape highly regarded by Sri Lanka's cricket elite, with Aravinda de Silva most notably among his champions. An opener by reputation, Thirimanne made his debut in early 2010 and earnt sporadic places in the national side over the next two years, but it was not until he was moved to the middle order in 2012 that he unearthed the consistency that would make him a regular at the top level.Thirimanne could not recreate that form in his first few Tests as an opener, but conjured his finest innings to date at no. 4, when he stepped off a plane 36 hours before the 2013 New Year Test to strike a sparkling 91 on the first day in Sydney. Ten days later he hit a maiden international hundred in an ODI to take Sri Lanka to victory in Adelaide."
78,Lokuge Dinesh Chandimal,"November 18, 1989, Balapitiya",31y 341d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"He made his international debut when only 21, and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in the 2010 triangular series in Zimbabwe. Four innings later, he made another century, this time against England at Lord's, but his stocks rose significantly in 2012, when he performed superbly in ODIs on successive tours to South Africa and Australia. In conditions he wouldn't have been used to, Chandimal occupied the crucial No.4 slot and revelled in the responsibility, scoring consistently. In 16 ODI innings in those two series, he aggregated 630 runs, including six fifties. He was equally impressive on his Test debut too, scoring fifties in each innings in Durban as Sri Lanka won their first Test in South Africa."
79,Balapuwaduge Manukulasuriya Amith Jeevan Mendis,"January 15, 1983, Colombo",38y 283d,Left hand bat,Legbreak,"Jeewan Mendis comes from a cricketing family, with his father Jagath and brother Tharindu also playing for his school, St Thomas' College. As a youth cricketer, Jeewan won several prestigious awards, including the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2001, the Man-of-the-Tournament awards in the Under-17 Asia Cup in Pakistan and the 2001 U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where he bowled a record-breaking spell of 7 for 19 against Zimbabwe. However, during his six years for SSC, he hardly got an opportunity to bowl his legspinners, but his move to Tamil Union in 2008-09 opened the doors for him to display his all-round talent."
80,Frank Dimuth Madushanka Karunaratne,"April 21, 1988, Colombo",33y 187d,Left hand bat,Right arm medium,"Dimuth Karunaratne is a solid left-hand opening batsman, and another alumnus of the St Joseph's College side that produced Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera, whom he also played with in the Sri Lanka Under-19 side. Karunaratne made his first class debut for Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in 2008, but had a quiet first season, batting largely in the middle order.He secured a place in the top order in 2009, and began to score more consistently thereafter. His maiden first-class century, against Colts Cricket Club, heralded a deluge of 1186 runs in the season, at an average of 56.54. His prolific form earnt him a call-up for the Sri Lanka A team against visiting South Africa A, where he again impressed, making 184 against an attack that included Vernon Philander."
81,Ranaweera Mudiyanselage Shaminda Eranga,"June 23, 1986, Chilaw",35y 124d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"He made his debut for Sri Lanka A in 2010 and following good performances on a tour of England in 2011, was flown back to Sri Lanka to be part of the national side, a move which fetched immediate results.A brisk fast-medium bowler, Shaminda Eranga's ODI and Test debuts were both spectacular: in his first ODI, against Australia in 2011, he needed only two balls to make an impact, bowling Brad Haddin through the gate. An even more memorable dismissal followed, when Ricky Ponting failed to read his slower ball and pushed back a return catch. He then made his Test debut against the same opposition, and became only the second Sri Lankan bowler to strike with his very first delivery, when he dismissed Shane Watson."
82,Seekkuge Prasanna,"June 27, 1985, Balapitiya",36y 120d,Right hand bat,Legbreak,"An accurate legspinner, and an improving late-order hitter, Seekkuge Prasanna has become one of several Sri Lanka spin options in limited-overs internationals. Quick through the air, and possessed of a good googly, Prasanna has largely been picked when the pitch is expected to take turn. He is prolific in domestic cricket, where he and Ajantha Mendis regularly run through teams on the spin-friendly Sri Lanka Army pitch at Panagoda. Prasanna has also recently begun to feature in foreign competitions, playing in the Bangladesh Premier League and for county side Northamptonshire, predominantly in the T20 Blast."
83,Senanayake Mudiyanselage Sachithra Madhushanka Senanayake,"February 09, 1985, Colombo",36y 258d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"Sachithra Senanayake is an offspinner who made his international debut for Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI in the series against South Africa in 2011-12. At the time of making his international debut, Senanayake had already taken 297 first-class wickets from 59 matches at a fantastic average of 20.50, and 107 List A wickets at an economy rate of 3.90. In the 2010-11 season, he was the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tier A of the Premier League tournament, taking 45 wickets in eight matches at 15.17. He has also shown that he can handle the pressure of limited-over matches: in the 2011-12 Premier Limited-Over tournament, Sri Lanka's main one-day competition, he was the highest wicket-taker with 16 in six games at 11.18."
84,Isuru Udana Tillakaratna,"February 17, 1988, Balangoda",33y 251d,Right hand bat,Left arm medium fast,"Udana is a talented left-arm fast-bowling allrounder, whose variety and changes of pace have seen him appear sporadically for Sri Lanka's T20 side. Capable of moving the ball off the seam, Udana is possessed of a number of slower balls, including one out of the back of his hand that has brought him some success at the top level. He was fast-tracked into the Sri Lanka squad for the 2009 World T20 in England and played a role in Sri Lanka's progress to the final in that tournament. However, he did not play the 2010 World T20, and had largely been ignored by the national selectors until early 2017."
85,Aththachchi Nuwan Pradeep Roshan Fernando,"October 19, 1986, Negombo",35y 6d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"Fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep didn't play with a cricket ball till he was 20 but less than three years later he was in Sri Lanka's Test squad. He won a pace contest in 2007, impressing the talent scouts in a soft-ball event, and was sent straight to Sri Lanka Cricket's academy. He follows in the Sri Lankan tradition of maverick bowlers with unconventional actions. Like Lasith Malinga, he has a slinging action and has troubled many batsmen in domestic cricket with his pace, generated from a long run-up. Pradeep toured Sri Lanka A to Australia in 2010, where he was among the quickest bowlers from both sides though he didn't bag many wickets. Less than a month later, he was rewarded with a call-up to the national squad for the second Test against India."
86,Mahamarakkala Kurukulasooriya Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera,"October 04, 1993, Panadura",28y 21d,Left hand bat,"Right arm offbreak, Legbreak","Another installment from Sri Lanka's production line of unorthodox spinners, Akila Dananjaya sparked controversy when he was picked in the preliminary squad for the 2012 World Twenty20, despite never having played a professional match in his life. Able to deliver a legbreak, googly, carrom ball, doosra and a stock offspinner with astounding control, he had impressed Mahela Jayawardene so much as a net bowler at a Sri Lanka practice session, that Jayawardene requested he be fast-tracked to the national squad."
87,Mathurage Don Kusal Janith Perera,"August 17, 1990, Kalubowila",31y 69d,Left hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"Possessed of a short backlift, powerful forearms and relentless bloody-mindedness, left-handed batsman Kusal Janith Perera's batting is not just inspired by his hero Sanath Jayasuriya's technique, at times, it seems an exact duplicate.Like Jayasuriya, he has a second skill - though it is wicketkeeping rather than slow left-arm, and he was part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, before he joined Colts Cricket Club as a senior. At Colts, Perera quickly set about forging a career founded on aggression and reliability in equal parts, and after two seasons, Sri Lanka's selectors could no longer ignore him."
88,Subasinghe Mudiyanselage Ashan Priyanjan,"August 14, 1989, Colombo",32y 72d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A busy middle-order batsman, packing a punch off the back foot, Ashan Priyanjan has been among the steady young risers in Sri Lankan cricket. Priyanjan captained Sri Lanka's under-19 team in the 2008 youth World Cup, and has since made himself a Sri Lanka A regular, through improving performances for Bloomfield, Tamil Union, and most recently, Ports Authority Cricket Club."
89,Pinnaduwage Chaturanga de Silva,"January 17, 1990, Galle",31y 281d,Left hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"A promising allrounder who delivers left-arm spin at a sharp pace and plays brisk innings from the lower order, Chaturanga de Silva made his international debut in the 2014 Asia Cup, after good returns for the A team against the visiting England Lions. Two forties and five wickets in the first unofficial Test in February cleared the path to his selection in the Asia Cup squad, in Rangana Herath's absence, but de Silva had been among the most consistent fringe players for over a year, both for the A team and for his domestic team, Moors Sports Club."
90,Dickwella Patabendige Dilantha Niroshan Dickwella,"June 23, 1993, Kandy",28y 124d,Left hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"An attacking left-hand and unorthodox wicketkeeper-batsman, Niroshan Dickwella arrived in first-class cricket already having built some hype through his stellar school cricket career. He won Sri Lanka's Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2012, having hit over 1000 runs in the previous season, and having led Trinity College to the national championship."
91,Pathira Vasan Dushmantha Chameera,"January 11, 1992, Ragama",29y 287d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18.Chameera's earned a place in Sri Lanka's Test squad to New Zealand at the end of 2014, but did not play a Test, despite a strong showing in the tour match. He was a late entry into the ODI squad for the same tour, and made his international debut in Wellington, and claimed the wicket of Ross Taylor with a 146kph delivery in his first over."
92,Paskuwal Handi Tharindu Kaushal,"March 05, 1993, Galle",28y 234d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A tall offspinner who extracts substantial turn, Tharindu Kaushal has been perhaps the most exciting young bowler in Sri Lanka's domestic circuit since he made his debut in early 2013. Working off a distinctive high-kneed approach to the crease, Kaushal uses his wrist, as well as his fingers, to put significant work on the ball - a ploy that is said to make his doosra particularly difficult to pick."
93,Tisse Appuhamilage Milinda Siriwardana,"December 04, 1985, Nagoda",35y 325d,Left hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"A busy middle-order batsman and a capable left-arm spinner, Milinda Siriwardana broke through to the national side in 2015 after several years of encouraging domestic returns. Outstanding form in the 2015 Premier League Tournament prompted his elevation. He was the first-class season's top scorer with 1144 runs at an average of 67.29, and had also claimed 20 wickets for Badureliya Cricket Club."
94,Sachith Shanaka Pathirana,"March 21, 1989, Kandy",32y 218d,Left hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"An allrounder who bowls slow left-arm, Sachith Pathirana's rise to the national side has been long-awaited, since his promising time in the Under-19 team. Pathirana captained Sri Lanka's U-19 side at the age of 17 in a one-day tri-series against England and Malaysia, and a year later, made a major impact in the 2008 U-19 World Cup, hitting 231 runs and taking 10 wickets.Having come through Trinity College in Kandy, Pathirana began his senior career at Colombo Cricket Club, before moving to Ragama Cricket Club, and eventually Chilaw Marians in 2012, for whom he had been a talisman. His strong first-class performances in the 2012-13 season did not escape the national selectors' attention, and he was named in the squad for Sri Lanka's home ODI series against Bangladesh, but Pathirana did not manage to nail down a place in the national squad."
95,Mashtayage Danushka Gunathilaka,"March 17, 1991, Panadura",30y 222d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A poised, attacking left-handed opener groomed in part at Sinhalese Sports Club, Danushka Gunathilaka was plucked from the domestic system largely on potential, and drafted into Sri Lanka's A team for the tour of New Zealand in mid-2015. He impressed on that trip, hitting two smart fifties from four innings, to finish as the team's second-highest run-scorer.Strong square of the wicket, particularly on the off side, Gunathilaka, who admires Kumar Sangakkara, is also a part-time offspinner. He had played in Sri Lanka's Under-19 team in the 2009 Youth World Cup."
96,Gampalage Shehan Naveendra De Fonseka Gunawarna Jayasuriya,"September 12, 1991, Colombo",30y 43d,Left hand bat,Right arm offbreak,His Odi debut Sri Lanka vs West Indies at Colombo 2015. last odi is Pakistan vs Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2019

98,Dhananjaya Maduranga de Silva,"September 06, 1991, Colombo",30y 49d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"A technically correct top-order batsman from the southern reaches of the island, Dhananjaya de Silva briefly caught the national selectors' eye in 2015, then went on to have a bumper domestic season that marked him out for more intensive national duty. De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings. What followed, though, was an emphatic blooming."
99,Balapuwaduge Kusal Gimhan Mendis,"February 02, 1995, Moratuwa",26y 265d,Right hand bat,Legbreak ,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four."
100,Madagamagamage Dasun Shanaka,"September 09, 1991, Negombo",30y 47d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls.. He played bright cameos in Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, and in April he was picked in the Test squad - for Sri Lanka's tour of England - for the first time, largely on his potential, rather than his first-class record."
101,Malmeege Amila Aponso,"June 23, 1993, Colombo",28y 125d,Right hand bat,Slow left arm orthodox,"An accurate left-arm spinner for Ragama Cricket Club, Amila Aponso emerged as one of Sri Lanka's better finger-spinning prospects, after successful first-class seasons in 2015 and 2016. A graduate of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, Aponso began his first-class career at Colts Cricket Club, but it was at Ragama that he rose to prominence. He claimed 31 first-class wickets at an average of 20.9 in the 2015 season, and was rewarded with a place in the Sri Lanka A squad to New Zealand, later that year."
102,Paththamperuma Arachchige Don Lakshan Rangika Sandakan,"June 10, 1991, Ragama",30y 138d,Right hand bat,Left arm wrist spin,"A slight, left-arm wristspinner from the outskirts of Colombo, Lakshan Sandakan's consistent hauls in first-class cricket have placed him among the Sri Lanka's best spin prospects. Operating off a shuffling approach and a quick action, Sandakan has the ability to turn the ball both ways, and skid it into the pad."
103,Weerahandige Inol Avishka Fernando,"April 05, 1998, Wadduwa",23y 204d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"A bruising right-hander - though not without aptitude for deft touch - Avishka Fernando turned heads while representing St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, before making good on his promise at the national Under-19 level.Fernando was making hundreds for his school's first XI before he was 14-years-old, and went on to become one of the school system's most prolific batsmen, hitting more than 1000 runs in the 2015 season. He was eventually picked for Sri Lanka's age-group teams, and made a hundred in his second Youth ODI innings, hitting 127 from 103 balls against visiting Australia Under 19s, in 2014."
104,Downdegedara Asela Sampath Gunaratne,"January 08, 1986, Kandy",35y 291d,Right hand bat,Right arm medium fast,"He was a sporadic performer when chosen in the A side, yet was immediately effective in Tests, hitting a fifty and a hundred in his first three international innings, against Zimbabwe. With Angelo Mathews ruled out of that tour, Gunaratne also earned a place in the ODI squad, and made an impact with his dibbly-dobbly slow-medium bowling, claiming eight wickets at an average of 14.5 as Sri Lanka won the tri-nations trophy in Zimbabwe, in November 2016. He had an impact in the shortest format too, helping Sri Lanka claim a T20 series in Australia in February 2017 by knocking off 84 in 46 balls in Geelong - three consecutive sixes in the penultimate over included, in a chase of 174."
105,Chandradasa Brahammana Ralalage Lahiru Sudesh Kumara,"February 13, 1997, Kandy",24y 255d,Left hand bat,Right arm fast,"A robust, right-arm fast bowler from Kandy, Lahiru Kumara had played only eight days of first-class cricket - all of which were for the Sri Lanka A team - before he was selected in the Test squad in October 2016. He was largely picked on his promise. One of the fastest bowlers in Sri Lanka's system, Kumara possesses a sharp bouncer, and an ability to both swing and seam the ball - all allied to a bustling intensity.He had played in the Under-19 World Cup in February, but it was on a u-19 tour of England that he put himself into contention for higher honours. He took a series-high 13 wickets at an average of 18.30 through the Youth Tests, and was especially effective at Northampton, where he claimed first-innings figures of 7 for 82, then a further 4 for 52 in the second innings to send England Under-19s to their first home defeat in six years."
106,Lahiru Dilshan Madushanka,"September 12, 1992, Matale",29y 44d,Right hand bat,Right arm fast medium,"A tall, bustling right-arm seamer, and a powerful lower-order batsman, Lahiru Madushanka worked his way into the national team following several seasons of consistent domestic performances.Having played his school cricket for St. Thomas' College, Matale, Madushanka impressed with bat and ball in his time in the Sri Lanka Under-19 side. He hit 235 runs at an average of 58.75 and claimed 12 wickets at 13.16 in a Quadrangular series in India, in 2011"
107,Pinnaduwage Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva,"July 29, 1997, Galle",24y 89d,Right hand bat,Legbreak,"A bruising lower-middle order batsman, and an aggressive legbreak bowler, Wanidu Hasaranga graduated from a strong Richmond College outfit, had a fine run in Sri Lanka's 2015 and 2016 Under-19 teams, and has made a promising start to his domestic cricket career."
108,Muthuthanthrige Vishwa Thilina Fernando,"September 18, 1991, Colombo",30y 38d,Right hand bat,Left arm medium fast,"A left-arm quick from Moratuwa, Vishwa Fernando has been earmarked for national duty, thanks largely to the skiddy pace he generates from a whippy action. Having made his first-class debut in 2012, Fernando showed early potential, claiming 26 wickets in his maiden season.He would get another break in 2015, when he was named in Sri Lanka's Test squad for the series against India, in August. This time, his selection was backed by wickets. Fernando had been the most penetrative quick in the 2014-15 Premier League Tournament, having claimed 40 scalps at an average of 21.97."
109,Eldeniya Medagedara Dilshan Yasika Munaweera,"April 24, 1989, Colombo",32y 185d,Right hand bat,Right arm offbreak,"An opening batsman of rare power, Dilshan Munaweera earned a call-up to the national side for the 2012 World Twenty20 after impressing at the inaugural SLPL, in which he was the top scorer. Brutal on anything short and almost as severe when bowlers overpitch, Munaweera is a firm convert of the Sanath Jayasuriya school of opening - hit it hard, long and over the infield. His 44 from 23 balls to clinch the SLPL title for the Uva Next franchise included five sixes and two fours."
110,Wedagedara Sadeera Rashen Samarawickrama,"August 30, 1995, Colombo",26y 57d,Right hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"In the longest format, Sadeera Samarawickrama is a dashing wicketkeeper-batsman who plays in the middle order. In limited-overs cricket, he has routinely set his teams off to fast starts as an opener. In any case, few school leavers of his vintage have made such a successful transition to the senior level. The national selectors have taken notice.Having begun his cricket at Colombo's Thurstan College, Samarawickrama moved to St Joseph's in his final years, and prospered in the school system, even hitting a memorable 126 in St Joseph's biggest fixture of the year. That performance propelled him into Sri Lanka's Under-19 squad, where he again impressed, making 265 runs at an average of 44.17 in the 2014 Youth World Cup."
